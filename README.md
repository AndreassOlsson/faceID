# faceID
Trying out different methods for performing face identification on faces that a model hasnÂ´t seen before. This repo only contains the exploratory ipynb files. At the time of creating this project I did not fully grasp all the methods that I implemented and did not achieve good results. Today, I am confident that I would be able to improve this model but I still gained some valuable insights from this project!

It is based on a siamese neural network that takes an image pair as input and calculates a latent feature for each image. The distance between those latent features then determines if the two faces belong to the same person or not.

The siamese neural network is more or less the resnet architecture implemented from scratch.
